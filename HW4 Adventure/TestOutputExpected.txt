What will be your adventure today? You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick
building.  A small stream flows out of the building and
down a gully to the south.  A road runs up a small hill
to the west.
> You are inside a building, a well house for a large spring.
There is a set of keys here.
> Taken.
> Outside building
> You are in a valley in the forest beside a stream tumbling
along a rocky bed.  The stream is flowing to the south.
> At your feet all the water of the stream splashes into a
two-inch slit in the rock.  To the south, the streambed is
bare rock.
> You are in a 25-foot depression floored with bare dirt.
Set into the dirt is a strong steel grate mounted in
concrete.  A dry streambed leads into the depression from
the north.
> You are in a small chamber beneath a 3x3 steel grate to
the surface.  A low crawl over cobbles leads inward to
the west.
There is a brightly shining brass lamp here.
> Taken.
> KEYS: a set of keys
LAMP: a brightly shining brass lamp
> You are crawling over cobbles in a low east/west passage.
There is a dim light to the east.
> You are in a debris room filled with stuff washed in from
the surface.  A low wide passage with cobbles becomes
plugged with mud and debris here, but an extremely narrow
canyon leads upward and west.  Unfortunately, the passage
is blocked by a barrier marked "Under Construction."
There is a black rod with a rusty star here.

> You are in a splendid chamber thirty feet high.  The walls
are frozen rivers of orange stone.  A narrow canyon and a
good passage exit from east and west sides of the chamber.
High in the cavern, you see a little bird flying around
the rocks.  It takes one look at the black rod and quickly
flies out of sight.

on.  Rough stone steps lead into the pit.

mist swaying to and fro almost as if alive.  There are
passages to the north and south, and a stone stairway
leads upward.

note says, "You won't get it up the steps."

the hall.  The mist is quite thick here.

from its tip which gain shape and substance over the chasm.
In moments, a shimmering crystal bridge spans the fissure.
After you cross, the bridge fades into nothingness.

> Inside building
> You are in a large room, with a passage to the south,
a passage to the west, and a wall of broken rock to the
east.  There is a large "Y2" on a rock in the room's
center.  As you enter, a hollow voice says "PLUGH".
> Low N/S passage

> You are at the east end of the Twopit Room.  The floor
here is littered with thin rock slabs, which make it easy
to descend the pits.  There is a path here bypassing the
pits to connect passages from east and west.  There are
holes all over, but the only big one is in the roof
directly over the west pit where you can't get to it.
> You are at the west end of the Twopit Room.  There is
a large hole above the pit at this end of the room.

> West end of Twopit Room
> You are in a circular chamber about 25 feet across.  The
floor is covered by white mist seeping in from the north.
The walls extend upward for well over 100 feet.  Suspended
from some unseen point far above you, an enormous two-sided
mirror is hanging parallel to and midway between the canyon
walls.  A small window can be seen in the wall some fifty
feet up.  The canyon has exits to the north and east.
> West end of Twopit Room
> West pit
> Dropped.
> As you water the plant, it bursts into violent growth,
quickly filling the entire pit and pushing you upward
toward the hole in ceiling.  You scramble for your life
and manage to catch hold of the rock and pull yourself to
safety.  The plant then shrinks away as quickly as it grew.
You are in the Giant Room.  The ceiling here is too high
up for your lamp to show it.  A cavernous passage leads
north.  There is a hole in the floor through which you
can see the Twopit room far below.
There is a nest of golden eggs here.

> You are in a magnificent cavern with a rushing stream,
which cascades over a sparkling waterfall into a roaring
whirlpool that disappears through a hole in the floor.
A passage exits to the south.
> You are dragged down, down, into the depths of the
whirlpool.  Just as you can no longer hold your breath,
you are shot out over a waterfall into the shallow end
of a large reservoir.  Gasping and sputtering, you crawl
weakly towards the shore.
You are at the edge of a large underground reservoir.
An opaque cloud of white mist fills the room and rises
rapidly upward.  The lake is fed by a stream, which
tumbles out of a hole in the wall about ten feet
overhead and splashes noisily into the water somewhere
within the mist.  The only exit is to the south.

Before you can think, the little bird flies from your
shoulder, attacks the green snake, and in an astounding
flurry drives the snake away.  The bird then flies back.
